# Stacking-Classifier-on-Diabetes-Dataset
This project implements a basic **stacking ensemble model** to classify diabetes outcomes using the **PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset**. Two base models (K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine) are used, followed by a **meta-classifier** (Random Forest) that learns from their combined predictions.
